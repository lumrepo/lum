# lum
lum is a package manager for my Linux distribution "lumos", it is based on slax, syntax:

lum install <package> [author]<br>
lum remove <package> [author]

To search for packages, he searches repositories on github by the contents of a description like: "lumpackage=lum", after which he takes the "lum.conf" file from the main branch in it from the first line takes a link to the sb file of the slax module and installs it, the author is not a mandatory field needed to install the package you need
